# Project Description
This is a *"mini data analyst project to analyze the trend of vegetable fat and animal fat availability"* in Indonesia from 2018 to 2022.

The project includes:
- Cleaning raw data using *Python & Pandas*
- Handling missing values
- Creating simple trend visualizations using *Matplotlib & Seaborn*

# Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Dataset
- `original_file.xlsx` → Original raw data
- `cleaned_lemak_data.csv` → Cleaned dataset ready for analysis

# Project Steps
1. *Load and inspect the dataset* 
2.*Clean the dataset* (drop unnecessary columns, fix missing values)  
3.*Create trend plots* for total fat availability

# Key Insight
The total fat availability in Indonesia fluctuates over the years. For example, there was a decrease in 2021, possibly related to changes in consumption or supply chain disruption during the pandemic.
